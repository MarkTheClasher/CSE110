#Hi
I'm Mark Lorenzo, a Computer Engineering student at UCSD.  You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/settings?trk=d_flagship3_profile_self_view_public_profile) 

I've worked with 
- C/C++, C#, Java, Python
- sorting/searching algorithms and code optimzation
- lists, stacks, heaps, queues, trees, sets, hashtables, graphs

###Some projects
Using Unity, I created a small autoscroll dodging game where the goal is to complete levels by traversing thru an autoscrolling obstacle course. *currently still on my local pc and unreleased*

Through Unity, I am beginning development of a 2d retro-style rpg that will feature a combination of unconventional gameplay styles and a compelling, realistic story that explore mental health struggles. *updates wil be posted here*


###Just Some Fun Things
My top 3 favorite foods in order are
1. Pho Dac Biet
2. Pho Dac Biet
3. Pho Dac Biet *(you get the point)*
   
On the side, I arrange soundtracks from popular video games for piano and compose my own orignal music.  I have a great appreciation of orchestral scores in anime and video games which is where I get my inspiration for some pieces that I write.  Speaking of which, I am also an ~~avid~~ gamer, *but that last bit was probably unecessary.*
